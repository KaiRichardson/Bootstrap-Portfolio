                            <p class="lead">I am currently getting certified in full stack web development at University
                                of Washington and will receive my certificate in the end of this summer. While I have a
                                comprehensive graphic design and front-end background, my emphasis is on back-end web
                                development. I am classically trained in all adobe, Microsoft and Autodesk products.
                                Upon being certified, I hope to work for a company that specializes in high level web
                                development and eventually produce and create pages for a large firm. </p>

                            <p class="lead">My current position as a Customer Support Specialist for Blueprint
                                Technologies gives me valuable experience in the tech sector. My reputation as an
                                important team member who always gets the job done comes from my demonstrated ability to
                                multitask. I've worked on projects such as drafting company correspondence, preparing
                                data reports for management, organizing company meetings and off-site events, and
                                helping customers with tricky questions daily. My experience has taught me the
                                importance of being proactive, and I pride myself on my ability to adapt to all kinds of
                                situations as they arise.</p>
